# 🏡 Task 3: Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task was to implement and understand both **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using a housing price dataset. The model predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of bathrooms, furnishing status, etc.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 📘 Pandas – for data manipulation  
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn – for building and evaluating regression models  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 What I Did
- ✅ Imported and cleaned the dataset  
- 🔄 Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding  
- ✂️ Split the dataset into training and test sets  
- 🧮 Built a **Simple Linear Regression** model using just the `area` feature  
- 🧠 Built a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using all features  
- 📈 Evaluated model performance using **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R² Score**  
- 📊 Visualized the regression line (for simple regression)  
- 📉 Plotted coefficient impact of each feature in the multiple regression model  

---

## 📈 Results
- ✔️ The model was able to capture general trends in the housing prices.
- 🔍 The feature **'area'** had the highest positive influence on price.
- ❗️ Features like **'furnishingstatus_unfurnished'** negatively affected the price.

## 📚 Concepts Learned
- Linear Regression assumptions and interpretation  
- How to handle categorical data in regression  
- Differences between MAE, MSE, and R²  
- Why simple regression and multiple regression are used differently  
- How to visualize regression models properly

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| MAE | Mean Absolute Error – average absolute error |
| MSE | Mean Squared Error – penalizes large errors |
| R² Score | Variance explained by the model |
